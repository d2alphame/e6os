This file describes the ABI of e6os.

All e6 programs are 64 bits and are loaded at address 0x200000 (that's the 2MB mark)
So programs begin with the following 2 lines (in nasm)

BITS 64
Org 0x200000

This address (0x200000) is also passed to the program in rbx.
rsi points to the literal string with which the program was called.
