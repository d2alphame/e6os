The Calling Convention of e6

When making a call
1.	First number goes into RAX, second number goes into RCX
2.	First string goes into RSI, second string goes into RDI
3.	First buffer goes into RBX, second buffer goes into RBP
4.	RDX is used when there is a third parameter of a given type. For example, use RDX as spare to pass in a third number, string, or buffer.
5.	If there are too many of a given parameter type, then pass all parameters in a buffer pointed to in RBX
6.	When there is an error, the carry flag is set, RAX contains the error code and RSI points to the error string
7.	Clear the carry flag on success.
8.	Strings are prefixed by their lengths.
9.	RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI, and RBP are volatile.
10.	R8 - R15 are preserved across calls
11.	The stack is used for making calls and as temporary working space
